## Overview
BTP Shipsy is a project management and evaluation platform designed for academic projects under the BTP program. The platform supports three types of users: students, supervisors, and admins. Each user role has distinct capabilities for interacting with project groups and evaluations.

- **Students** can create groups, view group details, and see evaluation results.
- **Supervisors** can view their assigned teams, evaluate teams, and view evaluation results.
- **Admins** can view all groups, manage group details, and view evaluation results.

The backend uses Node.js and Express.js with MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is developed with React.js.

## Features
- User registration and authentication for students, supervisors, and admins.
- Group creation with up to 3 student members and assignment of a supervisor.
- Submission and viewing of evaluation marks by supervisors.
- Admin dashboard for managing groups and viewing evaluations.
- Sorting and filtering functionality for groups.

## Architecture
